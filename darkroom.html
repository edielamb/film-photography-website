        <h1>Developing & Darkroom</h1>

        <img src="images/hangingfilm 1.png">
        <p>This page covers how to make unique prints of your negatives using color and B&W darkrooms, 
            along with tips on developing and color management.</p>
        
            <p>A darkroom is a space used to develop and print 
                photographs from film. In black and white (B&W) darkrooms, the film 
                is developed using a series of chemical baths, then images are printed 
                onto light-sensitive paper and processed in more chemicals under red or 
                amber safelights. Color darkrooms are more complex and require total 
                darkness, as color paper is more sensitive to light and the process 
                involves more precise temperature and chemical control. Each type uses 
                enlargers to project the film image onto photo paper before development. 
                Darkrooms give photographers hands on control over the final look of 
                their prints, including contrast, exposure, and tone.</p>

    <h2>Enlarger</h2>

    <img src="images/bwenlargernum.png">

    <p>1. Lens: The lens on a black and white enlarger focuses the projected image from the negative onto the photo paper.</p>
    
    <p>2. Timer: The timer controls how long the enlarger light stays on, determining the exposure time for the photo paper.</p>
    
    <p>3. Contrast filter: The contrast filter adjusts the image's contrast by controlling how different tones appear in the final print.</p>

    <p>4. Paper: The paper is light-sensitive and captures the image projected from the negative when exposed and developed.
    
    <p>5. Easel: The easel holds the photo paper flat and in place, helping frame and align the image during exposure.</p>

    <h2>Chemicals</h2>

    <img src="images/chemicals.png">
    <p>In black and white darkroom printing, the chemicals are used in a specific order:
    <br>
    <br>
    Developer: This brings out the image on the exposed photo paper by reacting with the areas hit by light.
    <br>
    <br>
    Stop Bath: This stops the development process immediately to prevent overdevelopment.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fixer: This makes the image permanent by removing any unexposed silver halide, so the paper can be exposed to light without changing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Water Wash: This rinses off all remaining chemicals to preserve the print and prevent damage or fading over time.

<div class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp">
    The ammount of time your print spends in each chemical can change the outcome of the image.
    For example, longer developing times will make the tones much richer and highly contrasted 
    vs shorter developing time which will made the image appear faded. Below are examples of
    the same image developed at three different ammounts of time:
