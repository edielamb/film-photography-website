            This page covers how to make unique prints of your negatives using

            A darkroom is a space used to develop and print photographs from
            film. In black and white (B&W) darkrooms, the film is developed
            using a series of chemical baths, then images are printed onto
            light-sensitive paper and processed in more chemicals under red or
            amber safelights. Color darkrooms are more complex and require total
            darkness, as color paper is more sensitive to light and the process
            involves more precise temperature and chemical control. Each type
            uses enlargers to project the film image onto photo paper before
            development. Darkrooms give photographers hands on control over the
            final look of their prints, including contrast, exposure, and tone.

            A black and white darkroom enlarger is what you will use to get your
            image from a negative to a full sized positive print. The enlarger
            projects light through a negative onto light-sensitive photographic
            paper to create a print. It uses a lens and adjustable height to
            control the size and focus of the image. The amount of light and
            contrast filters used during exposure affect the final print's
            brightness and contrast. Read about different parts of the enlarger
            corresponding with the numbers labeled on the image.

        <div class="menu">
          <h3>Parts of the Enlarger</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            1. Lens: The lens on a black and white enlarger focuses the
            projected image from the negative onto the photo paper.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            2. Timer: The timer controls how long the enlarger light stays on,
            determining the exposure time for the photo paper.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            3. Contrast filter: The contrast filter adjusts the image's contrast
            by controlling how different tones appear in the final print.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            4. Paper: The paper is light-sensitive and captures the image
            projected from the negative when exposed and developed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            5. Easel: The easel holds the photo paper flat and in place, helping
            frame and align the image during exposure.

          />
          <p>
            The ammount of time your print spends in each chemical can change
            the outcome of the image. For example, longer developing times will
            make the tones much richer and highly contrasted vs shorter
            developing time which will made the image appear faded. Below are
            examples of the same image developed at three different ammounts of
            time, can you notice the difference?
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          />
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Another way to adjust the tonal outcome of your images is to use
            Contrast Filters. Contrast filters in film darkrooms are used during
            the printing process to control the contrast of black-and-white
            photographic prints made from negatives. They adjust how the light
            exposes the photographic paper. The level of contrast in a filter is
            catagorized by number, usually ranging from levels 00 to 5, with
            lower-numbered filters (levels 0-2) producing softer, lower-contrast
            images and higher-numbered filters (levels 3-5) creating more
            dramatic, higher-contrast prints. This helps achieve the desired
            tonal range and emphasize details in highlights or shadows. The
            general rule of thumb is; higher contrast will make your black tones
            blacker, and your white tones whiter. Lower contast will do the
            opposite and make the tones appear in different shades of grey.

        </div>

        <div class="menu">
          <p>
            In black and white darkroom printing, the chemicals are used in a
            specific order:
            <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
            Developer: This brings out the image on the exposed photo paper by
            reacting with the areas hit by light.
            <br /><br /><br /><br />
            Stop Bath: This stops the development process immediately to prevent
            overdevelopment.
            <br /><br /><br /><br />
            Fixer: This makes the image permanent by removing any unexposed
            silver halide, so the paper can be exposed to light without
            changing.
            <br /><br /><br /><br />
            Water Wash: This rinses off all remaining chemicals to preserve the
            print and prevent damage or fading over time.

          <p>
            A color enlarger is different than a Black & White enlarger because
            it uses CMYK values to control the color. It also makes prints from
            color negatives by projecting the image onto color photographic
            paper. It has built-in adjustable CMYK filters to control color
            balance and contrast during exposure. By adjusting these filters,
            you can correct color casts and fine-tune the look of the final
            print. Read about different parts of the enlarger corresponding with
            the numbers labeled on the image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now in terms of devweloping the image, the color darkroom developing
            process differs from black and white in that it uses different
            chemicals specifically designed for color prints instead of the
            black and white developer, stop bath, and fixer. Color printing
            requires precise temperature control and timing, which is why it's
            often done using automated machines that ensure consistency. Unlike
            black and white printing, which can be done manually under a red
            safelight, color printing must be done in complete darkness because
            color paper is sensitive to all light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Producing color prints at home might be more difficult than bland &
            white. Although it is totally possible with the right tools and
            equipment, most people will find it eaier to simply send their
            negatives to a printing facility or a camera shop that has a fully
            functioning darkroom. Although they are rare, certain places offer
            darkrooms for rent, which makes it possible to do the printing
            process yourself.

            1. Color Dials: These dials control the amount of cyan, magenta, and
            yellow light to adjust the color balance of the print.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            2. Focuser: A small magnifier tool used to ensure the projected
            image from the enlarger is sharply focused on the paper.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            3. Lens: Projects the image from the negative onto the photographic
            paper and allows for adjustments in sharpness and exposure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            4. Easel: Holds the photographic paper in place and helps align and

          <p>
            Not pictured: similar to the black and white enlarger, color
            enlargers also include timers and require photographic paper (color
            paper works different than b&w paper! Make sure you use the right
            one).

        <!--Section 5: color values-->

          <h2>Color Values & Fine-tuning your Print</h2>
          <img

          <p>
            There are three primary colors in negative colour photography: red,
            green and blue. Inbetween that, there is cyan, magenta, and yellow.
            Each film emulsion contains three layers of filters sensitive to
            those colors, and the same applies to colour paper. When those
            layers are combined they create the full picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            As each film and batch of paper has different color dominance,
            you'll need do adjust the color dials to get the colour balance that
            you want. How do you do that? By using the enlarger's color dials.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tricky thing about printing color film is that adjusting the
            color levels works opposite. For example, on the color dials,
            increasing cyan removes red, increasing magenta removes green, and
            increasing yellow removes blue. If your image comes out too green,
            you likely need to ADD magenta, not decrease cyan + yellow. Think of
            it as a game of addition. On the right are examples of an image with
            different color levels, and what adjustments were made.
