            Street photography using film is the art of candidly capturing
            everyday life in public spaces with a film camera. It emphasizes
            real, unposed moments and often tells a story about society,
            culture, or human emotion. Film adds a timeless, gritty aesthetic
            that many photographers love for its texture, grain, and dynamic
            range.

          <h3>Key Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            1. Depth of Field:
            <br />
            Shallow DOF can isolate a subject from a busy background, drawing
            attention. Deep DOF keeps more of the scene in focus, great for
            layered compositions.
            <br /><br />
            2. Shutter Speed:
            <br />
            Fast shutter speeds freeze motion, ideal for capturing fleeting
            moments or people in action. Slow shutter speeds can blur movement,
            but require steady hands or a tripod.
            <br /><br />
            3. Lighting:
            <br />
            Natural light is key. Pay attention to shadows, golden hour light,
            and contrast for dramatic effects.
            <br /><br />
            4. Subject & Timing:
            <br />
            The best images often capture emotion. Anticipating action and
            staying ready with your camera settings pre-adjusted is important.

          <p>
            Black and white film photos printed on fiber paper are a classic and
            expressive form of photography, known for their rich tonal range,
            deep blacks, and archival quality. This traditional darkroom process
            emphasizes craftsmanship and gives each print a unique, tactile feel
            that digital or resin coated papers can't replicate. fiber based
            paper, unlike resin coated paper, absorbs chemicals and water,
            giving a more organic finish and deeper tonal depth. It takes longer
            to process and dry, but the result is a museum quality, archival
            print that can last for decades.

          <h3>Key Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            1. Test Strips
            <br />
            Make test strips to find correct exposure by ripping a paper into
            smaller pieces. This saves a lot of money in the long term. Test
            print areas with both highlights and shadows Adjust exposure based
            on test results
            <br /><br />
            2. Dodging and Burning
            <br />
            To fix contrast of specific areas, use dodging and burning. Dodging
            blocks light to lighten areas, Burning adds light to darken areas.
            This is done by covering the paper with a flat surface with a hole
            in it, then shining light through that hole to expose small areas to
            light.
            <br /><br />
            3. Washing
            <br />
            Washing is so important with fiber paper! Wash in running water for
            30-40 minutes, or use Hypo Clearing Agent (HCA) to speed washing.
            This ensures archival quality and prevents stains
            <br /><br />
            4. Drying and Flattening
            <br />
            Air-dry on screens or line (do not blot), this will take around 24
            hours. After that, flatten dry prints between boards or use a print
            dryer. Fiber curls and warps a lot after air drying so flattening is
            essential.

            Still life photography is the art of capturing inanimate objects
            that are often carefully arranged to create a visually compelling
            image. It focuses on composition, lighting, texture, and form,
            allowing the photographer full creative control over every element
            in the frame. Common subjects include everyday items like fruit,
            flowers, tools, or personal objects. The goal is to bring life and
            meaning to these items through thoughtful styling, dramatic
            lighting, and attention to detail, often evoking mood, symbolism, or
            storytelling.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="menu">
          <h3>Key Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            1. Controlled Lighting
            <br />
            Still lives are best shot in a studio or indoors. This can be hard
            to do with film, so choose a higher iso, or use natural window light
            or continuous artificial light (like lamps or softboxes). Modify
            light with reflectors or diffusers to soften shadows and highlight
            textures.
            <br /><br />
            2. Careful Composition
            <br />
            To make a good still life, apply the rule of thirds, symmetry, or
            leading lines to guide the viewer's eye. Pay close attention to
            object placement, balance, and negative space. The placement and
            position of the items should tell a story.
            <br /><br />
            3. Stable Setup
            <br />
            I would recommend using a tripod for sharp images and precise
            framing, especially with slower shutter speeds or small apertures.
            This will help keep consistency if you're changing stuff between
            shots.

          <p>
            Double exposure in film photography is a creative technique where
            two images are combined into one, either during shooting or in the
            darkroom. The most common method involves exposing the same frame of
            film twice in the camera. This is done by either manually rewinding
            the film slightly or using a camera with a built-in multiple
            exposure mode that allows you to take a second shot on the same
            frame. To avoid overexposure, each image is typically underexposed
            by about one stop. Thoughtful planning is key—areas of shadow in the
            first image can reveal highlights in the second, creating a balanced
            and interesting composite.
            <br /><br />
            In the darkroom, double exposures are created by printing two
            separate negatives onto the same sheet of photo paper. This is done
            by exposing one negative in the enlarger, then replacing it with a
            second negative and exposing again, either over the full image or
            selectively using dodging and burning techniques. This method gives
            more control over the final composition, allowing the photographer
            to adjust contrast, exposure, and alignment. Both in-camera and
            darkroom double exposures can produce surreal, dreamlike images,
            with the former offering a more spontaneous feel and the latter
            allowing for precision and experimentation.

          <h3>Key Techniques</h3>

          <p>
            In-Camera Double Exposure
            <br /><br />
            Underexpose Each Shot. Reduce exposure by about 1 stop per image to
            avoid overexposing the final frame.
            <br /><br />
            Plan Subject Placement. Compose so dark areas in one image allow the
            second image to show through clearly.
            <br /><br />
            Shoot one round of film focusing on texture, and the second round
            focusing on form. The order doesn't matter, but by doing this it
            ensures your photos come out looking dynamic, layered, and not too
            chaotic.

            <br /><br /><br /><br />

            Darkroom Double Exposure
            <br /><br />
            Balance Exposure Times. Use test strips to find the right exposure
            for each negative so one doesn't overpower the other.
            <br /><br />
            Use Masks or Dodging. Selectively block or allow light during each
            exposure to control which parts of each image appear.
