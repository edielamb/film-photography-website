    <h1>Camera Functions</h1>

    <p>
      A film camera is a device that captures images on photographic film rather
      than digitally. It uses light passing through a lens to expose the film,
      creating a chemical record of the scene. After shooting, the film must be
      developed in a darkroom or lab to produce visible photographs. Film
      cameras offer a distinct aesthetic and are still favored by some
      photographers for their vintage look and hands-on process.

    <h2>Camera Lens</h2>

    <p>
      A film camera lens focuses light onto the film strip to create a clear
      image. It controls the amount of light entering the camera through the
      aperture. The lens also affects depth of field and how much of the scene
      is captured, depending on its focal length. In film photography, the
      quality and type of lens greatly influence the final look of the photo.

    <h2>F-Stop & ISO</h2>
    <img src="images/placeholder.png" />
    <p>
      F-stop refers to the aperture setting on a film camera lens, which
      controls how much light enters the camera. A lower f-stop (like f/2.8)
      means a wider aperture, letting in more light and creating a shallow depth
      of field. A higher f-stop (like f/16) lets in less light and brings more
      of the scene into focus. F-stop settings help photographers balance
      exposure and control the artistic look of their photos.
      <br />
      <br />
      ISO in film photography refers to the film's sensitivity to light. A lower
      ISO number (like 100) means the film is less sensitive and best for bright
      conditions, producing finer grain. A higher ISO (like 800 or 1600) is more
      sensitive and useful in low light, but results in more visible grain.
      Choosing the right ISO is key to getting the right exposure and mood for a
      photo.

    <h2>Depth of Feild</h2>
    <img src="images/placeholder.png" />
    <p>
      Depth of field is the range of distance in a photo that appears sharp and
      in focus. A shallow depth of field means only a small part of the image is
      sharp, with the background and foreground blurred—great for portraits. A
      deep depth of field means most or all of the image is in focus—ideal for
      landscapes. Depth of field is affected by the aperture (f-stop), the
      distance to the subject, and the lens focal length.
